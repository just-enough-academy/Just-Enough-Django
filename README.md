# Just Enough Django

A Crash Course for Perfectionist Web Developers with Deadlines

This repository contains the code samples from the challenges and coding exercises for each presentation of _Just Enough Django_. Each presentation event is an orphaned branch named according to the date on which the presentation was given in `ISODATE` format, i.e. `YYYY-MM-DD` If the event spanned multiple days, the initial date of the event will be the branch name.

You can either download a ZIP archive _for just your branch_ or clone the whole repo and use `git checkout` to switch to it.
